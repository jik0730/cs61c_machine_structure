Mini-Biography:
==============
Classes can sometimes feel so impersonal!  We created this mini-bio so we may get to know each other a little better. 
This will be kept confidential amongst the staff, but you don't have to fill in anything you don't wish to.

** The staff will answer them too, so how about you? **


--> Where did you grow up? What was your academic path?
(e.g. Did you live in the same town all your life or did you move around; and if so, where? Did you go to community college or another school before this one?)
I was born in South Korea and have lived in Gumi, one small city in Korea. I am currently an exchange student from my home university, POSTECH. I have studied at Berkeley since Spring 2016.




--> How much programming have you done (and what languages)?
I learned of a little bit of computer science before becoming senior in my home university. After being senior, as a motivation of taking cs61b at Cal, I have been interested in computer science. Programming languages that I learned from taking cs courses are C, C++, Java. I studied some languages on my own, which are Python, html, css, javascript, PHP and those are not familiar to use for me because I didn't study those languages deeply. I have to have time to study more on those.




--> What are your hobbies?
My hobby is playing soccer and watching TV shows or movies.




--> What are some of your talents and skills?
Well, optimized thinking? which makes me live more comfortable. It makes annoyed things not happen.




--> Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything really memorable happened to you?
(e.g. travel, meeting famous people, 15 min of fame, inventions, overcoming adversity, etc.)
I fulfilled military duty for 2 years.
Every experiece in Cal is remarkable for me!





--> What commitments will be consuming your cycles this term?
(e.g. classes, jobs, family, commutes, volunteering, sports, student groups, etc.)
